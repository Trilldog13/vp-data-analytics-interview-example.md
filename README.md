## Senior Data Analytics Leadership Interview – Example Framework

While working on a VP of Data Analytics hire, I had a number of interesting conversations about the balance between technical credibility and leadership capability at senior levels.

What consistently emerged was that, while technical depth remains important, success in this role is more strongly driven by leadership, stakeholder management, and the ability to guide teams through change at scale.

The interview framework below reflects those conversations and is designed to assess how candidates think, lead, and influence, not just what they know.

In this case, we went for a 2 stage interview process.

### Objective

## How decisions are made

Interviewers use structured scorecards to capture evidence consistently and reduce bias.

Decisions are based on the overall body of evidence across interviews, rather than any single response or criterion.
